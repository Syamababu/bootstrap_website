                        <p>In today’s world, when technology plays an increasingly vital part in all aspects of our
                            lives, it’s critical that we choose a programming language that can efficiently address
                            real-world problems. Python is one such programming language. Python’s popularity has
                            skyrocketed in recent years, thanks to its use in a wide range of industries such as
                            software engineering, machine learning, and data science, among others. The multitude of
                            libraries that Python has to offer is the reason for its popularity. A lot of budding
                            talents of today are being attracted to <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener"

                                    target="_blank">Python</a></strong> as their primary choice of programming language
                            because of this reason and therefore, through this article, we would like to impart
                            knowledge to our readers about the most famous Python Libraries and their usage in today’s
                            modern world.</p>

                        <h2 id="what-is-a-library">What is A Library?</h2>
                        <p>A library is a collection of utility methods, classes, and modules that your application code
                            can use to perform specific tasks without writing the functionalities from scratch. Because
                            libraries often have a narrow scope (for instance, Strings, Input / Output, and Sockets),
                            their APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are smaller and require fewer dependencies.
                            It’s nothing more than a list of class definitions. Now the question which should arise in
                            everyone’s mind is why do we require libraries? The explanation for this is simple: code
                            reusability. Code Reusability means nothing but using code that has already been produced or
                            written down by other people for our own purpose. For instance, some libraries have a
                            function called findLastIndex(char) that returns the last index of a character in a string.
                            We may immediately call the library’s findLastIndex(charToFind) function and supply the
                            characters whose positions we need to find as a parameter. In the life of a programmer,
                            libraries play the role of an angel as they prevent programmers from reinventing the wheel
                            again and again and actually focus on the real problem.</p>

                            <li>Python comes with a plethora of libraries.</li>
                            <li>Python is a beginner’s programming language due to its ease and simplicity.</li>

                        <p>Pandas is a BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) licensed open-source library. This popular
                            library is widely used in the field of data science. They are primarily used for data
                            analysis, manipulation,&nbsp; cleaning, etc. Pandas allow for simple data modeling and data
                            analysis operations without the need to switch to another language such as R. Usually,
                            Python libraries use the following types of data:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Data in a dataset.</li>
                            <li>Time series containing both ordered and unordered data.</li>
                            <li>Rows and columns of matrix data are labelled.</li>
                            <li>Unlabeled information</li>

                        <p>NumPy is one of the most widely used open-source Python libraries, focusing on scientific
                            computation. It features built-in mathematical functions for quick computation and supports
                            big matrices and multidimensional data. “Numerical Python” is defined by the term “NumPy.”
                            It can be used in linear algebra, as a multi-dimensional container for generic data, and as
                            a random number generator, among other things. Some of the important functions in NumPy are
                            arcsin(), arccos(), tan(), radians(), etc. NumPy Array is a Python object which defines an
                            N-dimensional array with rows and columns. In Python, NumPy Array is preferred over lists
                            because it takes up less memory and is faster and more convenient to use.</p>

                        <p>Keras is a Python-based open-source neural network library that lets us experiment with deep
                            neural networks quickly. With deep learning becoming more common, Keras emerges as a great
                            option because, according to the creators, it is an API (Application Programming Interface)
                            designed for humans, not machines. Keras has a higher adoption rate in the industry and
                            research community than TensorFlow or Theano. It is recommended that you install the
                            TensorFlow backend engine before installing Keras.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Scipy is a free, open-source Python library used for scientific computing, data processing,
                            and high-performance computing. The library contains a huge number of user-friendly routines
                            for quick computation. The package is based on the NumPy extension, which allows for data
                            processing and visualization as well as high-level commands. Scipy is used for mathematical
                            computations alongside NumPy. NumPy enables the sorting and indexing of array data, while
                            SciPy stores the numerical code. Cluster, constants, fftpack, integrate, interpolate, io,
                            linalg, ndimage, odr, optimize, signal, sparse, spatial, special, and stats are only a few
                            of the many sub packages available in SciPy. “from scipy import subpackage-name” can be used
                            to import them from SciPy. NumPy, SciPy library, Matplotlib, IPython, Sympy, and Pandas are,
                            however, the essential packages of SciPy.</p>

                            <figcaption>Theano</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>NumPy integration: Theano can use NumPy arrays entirely in Theano compiled functions.
                            </li>
                            <li>Use of a transparent GPU: It can be used to perform data-intensive operations
                                significantly faster than with a CPU.</li>
                            <li>Efficient symbolic differentiation: Theano does derivatives for functions with one or
                                more inputs using efficient symbolic differentiation.</li>
                            <li>Optimizations for speed and stability: For problems like getting the correct solution
                                for log(1+x) even when x is very small, Theano works well. This is just one of the many
                                pieces of evidence of Theano’s stability.</li>
                            <li>C code generation that is dynamic: Theano can evaluate expressions fast resulting in a
                                significant increase in efficiency.</li>
                            <li>Extensive unit-testing and self-verification: Theano can help detect and diagnose
                                numerous types of problems and ambiguities in the model with extensive unit testing and
                                self-verification.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Theano expressions use a symbolic syntax, which might be confusing for newcomers who are used
                            to traditional program development. In particular, expressions are specified in an abstract
                            sense, compiled, and then used to do calculations. It is designed to handle the types of
                            processing required by Deep Learning’s huge neural network algorithms. It is an industry
                            standard for Deep Learning research and development and was one of the first libraries of
                            its sort. As of today, Theano is the backbone of a slew of neural network projects, and its
                            popularity is only growing.</p>

                        <p>The easy-to-use Python programming language has found widespread use in a variety of
                            real-world applications. Because it is a high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted
                            language, it is rapidly expanding in the areas of error debugging. Python is increasingly
                            being used in global applications such as YouTube, DropBox, and others. Furthermore, with
                            the availability of Python libraries, users can perform a variety of tasks without having to
                            write their own code. Therefore, it becomes extremely important for any budding talent of
                            today to learn about Python and its libraries. The application of Python in a variety of
                            fields like Data Science, Machine Learning, Software Engineering, etc. definitely makes it
                            the language for the future.&nbsp;</p>

                                Python?</span></h3>
                        <p><strong>Ans:</strong> There are two ways in which we can list all the libraries in Python:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using the <strong>help </strong>function: To acquire a list of installed modules in
                                Python, we can use the help function. We can type the following command into the Python
                                prompt and it will display a list of all the modules that have been installed on the
                                system..</li>
                        </ul>
                        <pre class="wp-block-code"><code>help("modules")</code></pre>
                        <p>We do not need to install any additional packages to list it; nevertheless, we must manually
                            search or filter the list for the appropriate module.</p>
                        <ul start="2">
                            <li>Using <strong>python-pip:</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt-get install python-pip
pip freeze </code></pre>
                        <p>Using this method, even though we need to install additional packages for using this, we
                            easily search or filter the result with grep command as shown below:</p>
                        <pre class="wp-block-code"><code>pip freeze | grep feed</code></pre>
